Start knowing.\nestimated_time: 5 minutes\n===END_META===\n\n===COVER===\n# HIRING DECISION CANVAS\n\nStop guessing. Start knowing.\n\nIn 5 minutes, you will have a clear, data-backed answer on whether to hire or optimize.\n===END_COVER===\n\n===CONTEXT===\n## Why This Matters\n\nEvery week you delay this decision costs you money. Hire too early and you waste 50K+ on someone you do not need. Hire too late and your team burns out, your best people leave, and projects fail. Both paths lead to the same place: regret.\n\nThis tool forces you to look at the numbers. No gut feelings. No I think we need someone. Just data. You will know exactly where your team stands and what move to make next.\n===END_CONTEXT===\n\n===DIAGNOSTIC:1===\n## Assess Your Current Capacity\n\n**The Question:** Is your team actually maxed out, or does it just feel that way?\n\n### INPUT:1.1\n- id: team_size\n- label: Current team size (headcount)\n- type: number\n- min: 1\n- max: 100\n- placeholder: e.g., 8\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:1.1\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Small team = high agility. Every hire changes your culture dramatically.\"\n  - insight: \"At this size, one wrong hire can poison the entire team.\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Mid-size team. You have some buffer but not much.\"\n  - insight: \"Communication overhead is real. More people does not always mean more output.\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Large team. Are you sure you need more people?\"\n  - insight: \"Before hiring, audit your current team. Who is underperforming?\"\n\n### INPUT:1.2\n- id: avg_hours_worked\n- label: Average hours worked per week (per person)\n- type: slider\n- min: 30\n- max: 70\n- default: 45\n- unit: hours\n- markers: [{ value: 30, label: \"30h\" }, { value: 45, label: \"45h\" }, { value: 60, label: \"60h\" }, { value: 70, label: \"70h\" }]\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:1.2\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Healthy workload. Your team has capacity.\"\n  - insight: \"No need to hire. Optimize what you have first.\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Moderate load. Watch for early burnout signs.\"\n  - insight: \"You have some room. Could you redistribute work before hiring?\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Danger zone. Your team is burning out.\"\n  - insight: \"This is unsustainable. Action required within 30 days.\"\n\n### INPUT:1.3\n- id: stress_level\n- label: Team stress level (your honest assessment)\n- type: slider\n- min: 1\n- max: 10\n- default: 5\n- markers: [{ value: 1, label: \"Calm\" }, { value: 5, label: \"Tense\" }, { value: 10, label: \"Breaking\" }]\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:1.3\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Low stress. Your team is in good shape.\"\n  - insight: \"Do not mistake calm for boredom. Check engagement too.\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Elevated stress. Normal during growth phases.\"\n  - insight: \"Monitor weekly. If this persists 4+ weeks, take action.\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Critical stress. People will leave if you do not act.\"\n  - insight: \"Your best performers are already updating their LinkedIn.\"\n===END_DIAGNOSTIC===\n\n===DIAGNOSTIC:2===\n## Measure the Gap\n\n**The Question:** What is actually falling through the cracks?\n\n### INPUT:2.1\n- id: deadlines_missed\n- label: Deadlines missed in last quarter\n- type: number\n- min: 0\n- max: 20\n- placeholder: e.g., 3\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:2.1\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Excellent delivery record. Your team is reliable.\"\n  - insight: \"If you are hitting deadlines, do you really need more people?\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Some slippage. Identify the pattern.\"\n  - insight: \"Is it the same project type? Same team member? Same client?\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Consistent misses signal a systemic problem.\"\n  - insight: \"Hiring will not fix broken processes. Fix the system first.\"\n\n### INPUT:2.2\n- id: skill_gaps\n- label: Do you have critical skill gaps?\n- type: select\n- options: [{ value: \"none\", label: \"No gaps - team covers everything\", score_impact: 0 }, { value: \"minor\", label: \"Minor gaps - workarounds exist\", score_impact: 30 }, { value: \"major\", label: \"Major gaps - blocking growth\", score_impact: 70 }, { value: \"critical\", label: \"Critical gaps - losing deals because of it\", score_impact: 100 }]\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:2.2\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Your team has the skills you need.\"\n  - insight: \"Training existing team is often faster than hiring.\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Gaps exist but you are managing.\"\n  - insight: \"Could a contractor or consultant fill this temporarily?\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Skill gaps are costing you money.\"\n  - insight: \"This is a valid reason to hire. Be specific about what you need.\"\n\n### INPUT:2.3\n- id: revenue_per_employee\n- label: Revenue per employee (EUR K per year)\n- type: number\n- min: 50\n- max: 500\n- placeholder: e.g., 150\n- required: true\n\n### FEEDBACK:2.3\n- IF value <= 30%:\n  - indicator: red\n  - message: \"Low revenue per head. Adding people will make this worse.\"\n  - insight: \"Fix efficiency before scaling. More people = more losses.\"\n\n- IF value 31-70%:\n  - indicator: yellow\n  - message: \"Moderate efficiency. Room for improvement.\"\n  - insight: \"Could you hit 200K per head with process improvements?\"\n\n- IF value > 70%:\n  - indicator: green\n  - message: \"Strong revenue per head.

Do not hire yet.\"\n- explanation: \"The data shows your current team is not maxed out. Adding headcount now would be premature and expensive. Focus on process improvements, skill development, and workload redistribution first.\"\n- primary_action: \"Audit your current processes this week. Find the bottleneck.\"\n- secondary_actions: [\"Run a time audit with your team\", \"Identify your top performer workflow and replicate it\", \"Remove one recurring meeting\"]\n\n### SCORE 36-65: PREPARE TO HIRE\n- color: #FFF469\n- headline: \"You are approaching capacity. Start recruiting now.\"\n- explanation: \"Your team is stretched but not breaking. You have 60-90 days before things get critical. Use this time to find the right person, not just any person.\"\n- primary_action: \"Write the job description this week. Be specific about the skill gap you are filling.\"\n- secondary_actions: [\"Define your non-negotiable requirements\", \"Set your salary range before interviewing\", \"Ask your network for referrals\"]\n\n### SCORE 66-100: HIRE NOW\n- color: #FF6B6B\n- headline: \"Your team is maxed out. Hire immediately.\"\n- explanation: \"The numbers do not lie. Your team is at breaking point. Every week you delay, you risk losing your best people and missing critical deadlines. Stop deliberating and start recruiting.\"\n- primary_action: \"Post the job today. Not tomorrow. Today.\"\n- secondary_actions: [\"Consider a contractor while you find the permanent hire\", \"Protect your top performers from burnout\", \"Be prepared to pay market rate or above\"]\n===END_VERDICTS===\n\n===SCORING===\n## Score Calculation\n\n### Weights:\n- input_1_1: 1\n- input_1_2: 4\n- input_1_3: 3\n- input_2_1: 3\n- input_2_2: 4\n- input_2_3: 2\n\n### Formula:\nHigher hours worked, higher stress, more deadlines missed, and bigger skill gaps = higher score = more urgent need to hire. Low revenue per employee reduces the score because you cannot afford to hire.\n===END_SCORING==="
