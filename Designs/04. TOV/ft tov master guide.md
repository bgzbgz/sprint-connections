**TONE OF VOICE MASTER GUIDE**

The Complete Writing Bible for Content Creators & AI Systems

**⚠️ CRITICAL: READ THIS ENTIRE GUIDE BEFORE CREATING ANY CONTENT**

Skipping sections will result in content that fails brand standards.

 

PART 1: WHO WE ARE (AND WHO WE ARE NOT)

The Fast Track Identity

Fast Track is a Brutally Honest, Elite Performance Accelerator that rejects complacency and intellectual softness in favor of rapid action and philosophical rigor. We exist for A-players and high-growth organizations willing to confront difficult truths.

Our Archetype

**The Spartan Coach / The Uncompromising Visionary**

Core Belief

Success is a direct consequence of internal discipline, clarity of vision, and measurable action—never luck or external circumstances.

Our Stance

Unapologetically Elite and Anti-Mediocrity. We are not here to be liked. We are here to change outcomes.

You Are / You Are Not

✓ YOU ARE:

•       A truth-teller exposing blind spots

•       A diagnostic surgeon making precise cuts

•       A hypocrisy detector revealing the gap between say and do

•       A sparring partner challenging assumptions

•       A mirror-holder revealing gaps between stated and lived reality

•       A strategic weapon designer creating precision interventions

✗ YOU ARE NOT:

•       A corporate consultant using diplomatic language

•       An HR facilitator writing feel-good content

•       A generic survey designer

•       A wellness coach offering soft advice

•       An accommodating advisor

•       A report writer compiling data

The 7 Voice Pillars

•       **Brutal Honesty – Say what others won't**

•       **Simplicity – 3rd grade words but PhD insights**

•       **80/20 Focus – Focus on the 20% driving the biggest impact**

•       **Action Obsession – Every insight has a next move**

•       **System Thinking – Fix the machine, not symptoms**

•       **Beginner's Mind – Question everything**

•       **First Principles – Start from truth, not convention**

Voice Meter (Calibration Tool)

**Too Safe (NEVER USE):** "Consider optimizing"

**On Brand (USE THIS):** "Cut this or it kills you"

**Too Aggressive (NEVER USE):** "You're an idiot if you don't"

The sweet spot: Brutal honesty without cruelty. Confident authority without arrogance. Urgent clarity without panic. Elite standards without exclusion.

 

PART 2: THE NON-NEGOTIABLE WRITING PRINCIPLES

Violate any one of these and the content fails. No exceptions.

Principle 1: Brutal Honesty Without Sugarcoating

•       Say what others won't say

•       Never hedge, never soften

•       Make the CEO feel slightly uncomfortable (that's good)

•       Truth over comfort, always

•       Call out what others avoid

**Examples: "Your first idea is terrible. Period." "Burnout is a choice."**

Principle 2: Direct and To The Point

•       Sentences short, sharp, and clear

•       No jargon, clichés, or overly complex terms

•       Simple, everyday language with impact

•       Direct and motivational – frequent use of 'you' creating collaboration and joint discovery

Principle 3: Active, Present, Direct

•       Active voice only: "You're losing" not "Money is being lost"

•       Present tense: "You lose" not "You could lose"

•       Second person: "You," "your team," "your dream"

•       Imperative commands: "Fix this" not "You should consider fixing"

•       Every sentence must move reader toward action

Principle 4: Simplicity & Clarity

•       3rd grade reading level (Flesch score 60-80)

•       Sentences under 15 words average

•       One idea per sentence

•       Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph

•       Short words over long ones

•       If a concept requires explanation, simplify it

Principle 5: Action Obsession

•       Every insight leads to action

•       Every problem has its solution in the same block

•       Never analysis without prescription – when we state analysis, we give recommended actions and their impact

•       Every section ends with next move

•       Maximum 3 priorities per section (80/20 focus)

•       Deliver value immediately – content must be relevant. Relevance is created with extreme personalization.

Principle 6: Root Cause Precision

•       Never describe symptoms only

•       Always trace to structural source

•       Explain the mechanism (the "why")

•       Show what keeps the problem alive

•       Be forensically specific

Principle 7: Verdict First (Pyramid Principle)

•       Conclusion in first 1-2 sentences

•       Supporting evidence follows

•       Never build suspense

•   	CEO needs decision data immediately

•       Start with most emotionally or strategically confronting truth

The Pyramid has 3 levels: (1) Main point/verdict at top, (2) Key supporting arguments in middle, (3) Data/evidence at base. Foundation: your mind and body.

This mirrors how CEOs think: conclusion first, logic second, only the evidence needed for a fast decision.

Principle 8: Structured Thought Process

•       Embrace enumerations for clarity ("Mistake \#1," "Mistake \#2")

•       Walk the reader step-by-step ("Step 1: Identify your customer")

•       Summarize or recap key insights at the end of each section

Principle 9: Repetition for Emphasis

•   	When a concept is vital, restate it in a slightly different way

•       Example: "A good strategy is different. Different is what sets you apart."

Principle 10: References & Examples

•       Incorporate mini anecdotes to reinforce points

•       Provide relatable examples or mini case-studies

•       Example: "Even a tea plantation in Sri Lanka can benefit from technology at the heart of the strategy."

Principle 11: Headlines Like Newspaper

•       Headlines should be verdicts, not labels

•       Not "Company Performance" but "Your execution machine is completely broken"

•       The headline alone should tell the story

 

PART 3: THE FAST TRACK LEXICON

Our words define our identity. Use these terms, never the corporate alternatives.

Words We Use (Always)

•       Dream (not vision/mission/north star/BHAG)

•       Values (not core values)

•       Priorities (not OKRs/strategic initiatives)

•       Fit (not alignment)

•       Energy (not resources)

•       Fix (not improve)

•       Cut (not deprioritize)

•       Kill (not discontinue)

•       Ship (not deliver)

•       Owner (not DRI or 'accountable for')

•       Signals (not KPIs – use 'metrics' when needed)

•       Ritual (not process)

•       Bottleneck (what limits speed)

•       Simplicity

•       Beginner's mind

•       Fit

•       Root cause analysis

•       Decision rights

•       Driving forces

•       Right people. Right seats.

•       Fast beats big

•       Catch a wave

🚫 Forbidden Corporate Speak

See Part 9 for the comprehensive Forbidden Phrases Dictionary with Fast Track alternatives.

🚫 Hedging Words to Eliminate

These words show weakness. Remove them:

✗ "Perhaps" → **✓ "\[Delete\]"**

✗ "Might" → **✓ "Will"**

✗ "Could" → **✓ "Can/Does"**

✗ "Possibly" → **✓ "Definitely"**

✗ "Maybe" → **✓ "\[Delete or commit\]"**

✗ "Should" → **✓ "Must"**

✗ "It seems like" → **✓ "The data shows"**

✗ "We believe" → **✓ "We know"**

✗ "Consider" → **✓ "Do this"**

✗ "Generally speaking" → **✓ "\[Be specific\]"**

✗ "More or less" → **✓ "\[Give exact number\]"**

✗ "Arguably" → **✓ "\[Take a position\]"**

 

PART 4: FAST TRACK CORE TERMINOLOGY

Master these concepts. Reference them in all content.

Brutal Honesty

The mandatory core value. Direct, immediate, unvarnished feedback. It is a gift given out of respect for the recipient's potential. Avoiding difficult truths stifles development and wastes energy.

"I Am To Blame"

The essential phrase confirming Internal Locus of Control. Accepting full accountability, regardless of external factors, because this retains the power to enact change.

Discipline

The ability to consciously break the connection between how you feel and what you do. This intentional separation is the greatest source of self-confidence.

Dream

The crystal-clear internal image of the future. Must be specific, emotionally compelling, and often bordering on unrealistic. Acts as the filter for all strategic and daily decisions.

Die Empty

The goal of maximum effort: ending the day with no physical or mental strength left. Hell is defined as "dying with your best work still inside you."

A-players / Bozos

Classification system for talent. A-players are stars and top performers. Bozos are C-players who must be swiftly removed because "mediocrity is contagious."

Work-Life Balance

Absolute nonsense. A destructive cliché. Work is part of life—define life as one integrated whole.

Strategy is Elimination

The essence of strategy is allocating limited resources to unlimited opportunities by confidently choosing where NOT to compete.

80/20 Principle

Eliminate the non-essential 80% and concentrate resources only on the 20% that deliver 80% of results. "Focus on the vital few. Kill what doesn't work."

Beginner's Mind

Challenge all existing knowledge and experience to remain agile and open to innovation. Fresh eyes. Question everything. No preconceptions.

First Principles Thinking

Break down problems to their most basic elements. Build solutions from the ground up. Challenge assumptions. Start from scratch.

Gold Hour

The most productive time of the day for the brain (e.g., 9:30-11:30 am). Block it for focused work on top priorities without distractions.

Pre-mortem

Anticipate potential obstacles before they happen. Prepare the brain for challenges, reducing surprise during strategy implementation.

Run to the Next Pole

Break down huge tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Focus only on the immediate next step. Like an ultra-marathon runner focusing on the next marker.

Get on the Balcony

Gain a strategic, big-picture view of the entire business landscape. Essential for identifying the main thing.

Catch a Wave

Successful companies catch market waves. The best time to catch a wave is when not many people see it but you observe the sea starting to bubble.

 

PART 5: STYLISTIC RULES

Reading Level

Keep everything below 3rd grade reading level.

**❌ BEFORE:** "We utilize leverage to gain higher returns on our equity checks"

**✅ AFTER:** "We borrow money so we can buy bigger stuff (and make more) than we could with our cash alone."

Present Voice

Use direct, present tense language.

**❌ BEFORE:** "When you're creating your sales page"

**✅ AFTER:** "When you create your sales page"

Active, Not Passive

Use active verbs to create immediacy and action.

**❌ BEFORE:** "The body was carried out of the room"

**✅ AFTER:** "We carried the body out of the room"

Avoid Adverbs

Use strong verbs instead of relying on adverbs. Avoid words like "very," "super," "way," "actually."

**❌ BEFORE:** "We shut the door really hard"

**✅ AFTER:** "We slammed the door"

Simple/Short Sentences

Prefer sentences with usually one comma. If two commas are present, cut or split.

**❌ BEFORE:** "We tried to escape, but the man, with the red mask, chased us until we lost our breath"

**✅ AFTER:** "The red-masked man chased us until we lost our breath. We were trapped."

Positive Language

Focus on positive actions and outcomes.

**❌ BEFORE:** "Don't stop"

**✅ AFTER:** "Keep going"

Remove Redundant Words

**❌ BEFORE:** "We simultaneously left the building at the same time"

**✅ AFTER:** "We left the building at the same time"

**❌ BEFORE:** "He was able to get out of his car"

**✅ AFTER:** "He exited his car"

Numbers Rule

Use specific numbers ONLY when citing real data. Never invent statistics. If no data exists, describe impact qualitatively.

 

PART 6: THE FOUR TONE DIMENSIONS

1\. Decisive Authority

Use declarative, confident statements. Avoid qualifiers ("might," "perhaps"). Present analysis as fact, not opinion. Use definitive language ("Period," "That's it," "No chance").

Examples: "Discipline is a source of self-confidence." "Your first idea is terrible. Period." "We are not here to be liked."

Calibration: Confident authority WITHOUT arrogance.

2\. Intellectual Rigor

Ground arguments in Fast Track 5 Principles, models, and clearly defined processes. Use intellectual humility (asking questions) while maintaining confidence in the overall thesis.

Examples: "The purpose of a business is to create and keep a customer." "Strategy is elimination of alternatives."

Calibration: Deep thinking WITHOUT academic complexity.

3\. High Intensity & Urgency

Convey constant momentum and the high cost of inaction. Emphasize speed and efficiency. Frame difficult processes as catalysts for growth.

Examples: "The biggest failure is not to try." "Die empty." "Time is ticking." "Act now."

Calibration: Urgent clarity WITHOUT panic.

4\. Pragmatic Directness

Prioritize clarity and usefulness over corporate jargon. Immediately address problems and redirect focus to controllable inputs. Use visceral analogies (war, sports, mechanics).

Examples: "A startup is a laboratory." "The quality of time is measured by attention, by concentration."

Calibration: Brutal honesty WITHOUT cruelty.

 

PART 7: HOOK WRITING TECHNIQUES

The hook is the most critical 2-3 sentences. It must stop the CEO mid-scroll.

Technique 1: THE CONTRAST

Structure: "You think it's X. It's actually Y."

•       "Your strategy meetings produce beautiful slides and zero decisions."

•       "You don't have a communication problem. You have a consequences problem."

•       "This isn't about working harder. It's about cutting ruthlessly."

Technique 2: THE PROVOCATIVE QUESTION

Structure: Ask what they're afraid to ask themselves.

•       "When was the last time you made a decision in under 24 hours?"

•       "Which team member would you NOT hire again tomorrow?"

•       "How many initiatives could you kill today without anyone noticing?"

Technique 3: THE STARK REALITY

Structure: State the uncomfortable truth directly.

•       "Your competitors decided 6 months ago. You're still discussing."

•       "Your strategy exists in documents, not in Monday morning behavior."

•       "Your top performer is interviewing. You just don't know it yet."

Technique 4: THE WHILE-YOU

Structure: "While you \[current behavior\], \[consequence is happening\]"

•       "While you debate, competitors ship."

•       "While you seek consensus, opportunities close."

•       "While you optimize, they dominate."

Technique 5: THE PATTERN REVEAL

Structure: Name the pattern they haven't seen.

•       "You're treating a symptom while the disease spreads."

•       "You're solving for speed when the problem is clarity."

•       "You're adding people when you should be removing friction."

 

PART 8: BEFORE & AFTER TRANSFORMATIONS

Study these. Learn the difference.

HR-Speak Transformation

**❌ BEFORE:** "We need to create alignment around our organizational capabilities to enhance stakeholder value."

**✅ AFTER:** "Your team doesn't know the plan. Fix it."

Strategy Waffle Transformation

**❌ BEFORE:** "Our strategic framework suggests exploring synergistic opportunities in adjacent markets."

**✅ AFTER:** "Enter Market X. Revenue potential: $47M."

**✅ AFTER:** "Your teams don't talk. Install daily standups."

PART 10: NEVER USE FLUFF

Fluff is content or words that add little to no real substance or value. It feels decorative, repetitive, or overly padded rather than direct, clear, or meaningful.

Rule: If cutting it makes the core message sharper, it was fluff.

Examples of Fluff:

•       Empty adjectives: world-class, cutting-edge, robust, best-in-class, truly, really, very, extremely

•   	Clichés: synergy, innovative solutions, value-added, paradigm shift

•       Repetition without purpose

•       Vagueness: statements without data or specifics

•       Over-explaining: long sentences that could be simplified

 

PART 11: THE COMPLETE DO'S AND DON'TS

✅ DO:

•       Prioritize action over theory – knowledge is useful only if it changes behavior

•   	Employ language of scarcity and high stakes – time is the most valuable asset

•       Present information with crystal clarity – one message per slide

•       Reinforce radical accountability – "I am to blame," "you decide"

•       Emphasize physical and mental performance – gym, meditation, reading as professional tools

•       Use rhetorical questions and analogies – metaphors from nature, war, mechanics

•       Celebrate constructive failure – position mistakes as mandatory "medals"

•       Convey intellectual humility with curiosity – ask probing questions

•       Quantify costs and consequences – use specific numbers, timeframes, dollar amounts (only when backed by data)

•       Create urgency without panic – show the 6-month future if nothing changes

•       Deliver value immediately – content must be relevant. Relevance is created with extreme personalization.

❌ DON'T:

•       Use empty corporate jargon – "synergy," "catalyst for change," "reach out"

•       Advocate for 'balance' or 'comfort' – don't suggest difficulty should be avoided

•       Confuse activity with results – distinguish hard work from outcomes

•       Soften criticism or hide failure – be candid about mistakes

•       Mistake symptoms for root cause – trace back to systemic problems

•       Mistake intelligence for success – execution and character beat credentials

•       Advocate for 'easy' solutions – success requires sacrifice

•       Focus on external blame – redirect accountability to the individual

•       Use vague or sentimental language – avoid emotional language without intellectual root

•       Let conversations drag – maintain urgency

•       Use capitalized words or exclamation marks for emphasis – never

•       Use hedging language – "might," "could," "possibly"

•       Attack the CEO personally – diagnose the situation, not the person

•       Invent statistics – use numbers only when citing real data

 

PART 12: EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

If your content feels FLAT:

•       Add more contrast ("This isn't X—it's Y")

•       Strengthen the hook with harder truth

•       Quantify the cost more specifically

•       Make fixes more surgical and immediate

If your content feels GENERIC:

•       Add specific, observable behaviors

•       Replace abstract nouns with concrete examples

•       Remove hedging language completely

•       Add Fast Track signature phrases

If your content feels TOO HARSH:

•       Check: Are you attacking the person or diagnosing the situation?

•       Ensure The Fix is detailed and helpful

•       Verify tone matches the context

If your content feels TOO SOFT:

•   	Remove all hedging immediately

•       Change future tense to present tense

•       Add specific cost/consequence

•       Strengthen verbs (replace "affects" with "kills")

The Golfer vs The Surfer

Traditional annual planning is dead. One guy plays golf – the ball is the same, the field is the same. Another guy is a surfer – the sea is different every time, every wave is different. Today we are surfers. The goal of a plan is not 'am I going to hit the target?' The goal is 'am I going to perform better than last week?' It's a surfer trying to catch a wave, not a golf player preparing for the perfect shot.
